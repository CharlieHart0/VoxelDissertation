# VoxelDissertation
Repository for my undergrad dissertation project, a voxel rendering and world generation system in Unity.

[The Assets Folder](/Unity%20Project%20Files/Assets) contains most of the scripts and assets that I have created, and the [Imported Packages folder](/Unity%20Project%20Files/Assets/Imported%20Packages) in that directory contains scripts that were made by third parties and imported.

[The Project Build Folder](/Built%20Project%20(Excecutable)) can be downloaded, and to run the game, run `Dissertation Project Voxel Rendering System.exe`

Test Data/ Results can be found in [Test Data Folder](/Misc%20Files/Test%20Data) 

A different repository was used during development, so the commit history here is not accurate.
